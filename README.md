# PURPOSE OF THE PROJECT

The aim of the project is to take information about the number of job offers from websites: Pracuj.pl, NoFulffJobs, JustJoin and TheProtocol.

# Backend Technology

It is realised using python with the selenium library, the data is saved to a json file.

# Frontend Technology

The data is processed by the pandas library and pie charts are then generated, depending on which option the user selects in the menu. The graphs are generated by the matplotlib library.

In order to provide a graphical interface, I used Flask and Tkinder to provide sychornization between the application and the database readings.
